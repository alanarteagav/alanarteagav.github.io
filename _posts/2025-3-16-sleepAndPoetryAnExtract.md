> What is more tranquil than a musk-rose blowing \
> In a green island, far from all men's knowing?
>
> More healthful than the leafiness of dales? \
> More secret than a nest of nightingales?
>
> More serene than Cordelia's countenance? \
> More full of visions than a high romance?
>
> What, but thee Sleep? Soft closer of our eyes! \
> Low murmurer of tender lullabies!

*Sleep And Poetry, John Keats - lines 5-12*
